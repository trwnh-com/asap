# as/ap

activitystreams / activitypub generic library? i have no idea what i'm doing.

built on python 3.x and intended to allow anyone to build whatever they want, both server and client. i.e. use pyqt or pygtk to build a desktop app using activitypub c2s, but also run a generic activitypub server for inbox/outbox of your generic activities. maybe even run the ap server locally on your desktop, idk.

not usable atm and may never be. mostly a thought exercise and learning experience.
